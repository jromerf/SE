WARNING:LIT:175 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_switches_3_BUFGP/switches_3_BUFGP/BUFG" (output
   signal=switches_3_BUFGP) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. Some of the
   non-clock loads are (maximum of 5 listed):
   Pin I0 of coprocesador_0/coprocesador_0/USER_LOGIC_I/leds<0>1
   Pin I0 of coprocesador_0/coprocesador_0/USER_LOGIC_I/leds<1>1

ERROR:Place:1018 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are
   not placed at an optimal clock IOB / clock site pair. The clock component
   <switches_3_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX7>. The IO component
   <switches<3>> is placed at site <H3>.  This will not allow the use of the
   fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer. If this sub optimal condition
   is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint in the .ucf file to demote this message to a WARNING and allow
   your design to continue. However, the use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design. A list of all the
   COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is listed below. These examples
   can be used directly in the .ucf file to override this clock rule.
