Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,657 out of  15,360   10%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,628 out of  15,360   17%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,960 out of   7,680   25%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,960 out of   1,960 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,960   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,732 out of  15,360   17%
    Number used as logic:             2,160
    Number used as a route-thru:        104
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      84

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 13 out of     173    7%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       4
  Number of RAMB16s:                     16 out of      24   66%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of       8   12%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.98

Peak Memory Usage:  4493 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 mins 8 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   55 secs
