Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,445 out of  15,360    9%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,993 out of  15,360   19%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,955 out of   7,680   25%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,955 out of   1,955 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,955   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,088 out of  15,360   20%
    Number used as logic:             2,205
    Number used as a route-thru:         95
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     704
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      84

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 19 out of     173   10%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       7
  Number of RAMB16s:                     17 out of      24   70%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of       8   37%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.04

Peak Memory Usage:  4527 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  40 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   39 secs
