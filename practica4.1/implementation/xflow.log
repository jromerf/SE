INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

WARNING:Route:463 - The router has detected a very dense, congested design. It is extremely unlikely the router will be
   able to finish the design and meet your requirements. To prevent excessive run time the router will exit with a
   partially routed design. This behavior will allow you to identify difficult designs earlier. The cause of this
   behavior is either overly difficult constraints, putting too much logic into this device, or an issue with the
   implementation. If you would prefer a fully routed design, ease the constraints (if any), remove some logic from the
   design, or change the placement before running router again. If you are willing to accept a long run time, set the
   option "-xe c" to override the present behavior.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0)

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
